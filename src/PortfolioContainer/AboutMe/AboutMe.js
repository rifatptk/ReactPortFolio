      <p>
        My name’s Rifat, I’m 26, have worked as a software engineer for a smaller
        company, in an agile team, working mostly on online maps, with JavaScript and
        Python. But just like many other startups this one eventually hasn’t taken
        of, and now I find myself unemployed. I prefer to work in a smaller
        team, and see the direct impact I have on a project, which is the reason
        no. 1 why I am applying for the job with you. Other than that I am more
        or less an ordinary guy, with a girlfriend and a dog, and a passion for
        model trains. Is there anything else you’d like to know about my life at
        the moment?
